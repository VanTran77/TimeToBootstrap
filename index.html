                History of fashion design. During the early years of the 
                1910s the fashionable silhouette became much more lithe and fluid, 
                and softer than in the 19th century.

                    History of fashion design refers specifically to the development
                    of the purpose and intention behind garments, shoes and
                    accessories, and their design and construction. The modern
                    industry, based around firms or fashion houses run by
                    individual designers, started in the 19th century with
                    Charles Frederick Worth who, beginning in 1858, was the first
                    designer to have his label sewn into the garments he created.

                    Fashion started when humans began wearing clothes.
                    hese clothes were typically made from plants,
                    animal skins and bone. Before the mid-19th century
                    the division between haute couture and ready-to-wear
                    did not really exist. But the most basic pieces of
                    female clothing were made-to-measure by dressmakers
                    and seamstresses dealing directly with the client.
